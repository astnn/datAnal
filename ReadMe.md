This repo host Python code solving the exercises of the DTU (www.dtu.dk) course
"30230 - Data Analysis and Modeling in Geoscience and Astrophysics" by Nils
Olsen. See https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/30230 for the course description.
The presented code is based on the lectures and exercises as given in 2018.
Matlab code solving the exercises is distributed as part of the course. The code
presented here is meant as a supplement for students already using Python or for
students looking to migrate from Matlab to Python.

It is assumed that the user is running the code using an IDE capable of
displaying plots and inspecting variables (e.g Spyder).
If the user desires to run the code straight from the terminal a shebang-line
should be added to the beginning of the scripts, plots should be saved to file
(e.g. using the matplotlib.pyplot.savefig() function) and values should be
printed to the terminal using print(). 

All code in this repository is made available under a GNU GPL-3.0 (or later)
license. Anyone is free to use, modify, and redistribute the code under the
terms of the license.
The full license is available in the file "COPYING" at the root of the
repository.
